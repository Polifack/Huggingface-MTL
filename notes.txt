- Funcy library allows to use standard functional programming functions such as flatten, map or first in python

- Easydict allows to create dict objects where instead of d["key"] we use d.key and we also can access elements with
a default value if key does not exist such as d.get("key", default)

- We can access classes by using eval function like for example
    encoder = eval(encoder_name) 
  is equivalent to 
    if encoder_name == "NaiveAbsolute":
        encoder = NaiveAbsolute
    elif (...)

- dataclasses are classes that instead of __init__(args) have args directly and if needed a __post_init__

- en token classification 
# NER: if the label is B-XXX we change it to I-XXX
# print(label)
# if label % 2 == 1:
#     label += 1
